# Agent J 0.15.3a1 release notes

Host 0.15.3a1 / install 0.19.3; phone-web scope.
Phone parity must pass --strict. Full Android/Telegram parity is incomplete.
Full Android/Telegram parity is incomplete.
No APK is included in this release. Android source is for review, not a released app.

Publication status: local preparation only. Live site verification is DEFERRED until
the public commit and tag are pushed, the site is deployed, and cold installation passes.

On publication failure, restore v0.15.2a1 / public 615ce72, including the site.
## Changes

- Sparse JSON5 configuration with transactional application, configuration history and migrations.
- Optional configuration skill for locally installed agent harnesses; owner permission required.
- Opt-in own-key cloud speech and local phone read-aloud.
- Optional owner-private Telegram text input and final replies.

- A phone that saved Face ID must pass Face ID before approving an admin-password or secret card; the computer
  verifies the assertion (bound to that card, one use). Deny never asks; phones without Face ID are unchanged.
- The full-screen reader shows the agent's local images inline; links to local files become cards in place.
- Telegram: the owner's private chat receives the files a reply refers to (same checks as the phone; groups get
  text only); /compact there writes the handover first. Codex writes a handover itself at about 85% context.
- Read-aloud can use ElevenLabs v4 (eleven_v4) or the owner's own local command; proxy.https / proxy.http values.
- OpenCode 1.x and 2.x both work (2.x through its /api); a missing key names the provider; after a key change
  or a key failure Agent J restarts its own OpenCode and resumes the conversation. `agentj provider` adds an
  OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible service by base URL, the key by name only.
- Real iPhone / Telegram / OpenCode-on-a-friend's-computer acceptance is pending; evidence is local Chromium,
  fake servers and the local real-model OpenCode run.

## Material acceptance limits

- Android arbitrary-name wake recognition, false-accept/false-reject rates, background operation,
  battery behavior and speech-model licensing are not cleared for a released app.
- Paid-provider sound and cost are unverified; no complete voice catalogue or hardware benchmarks.
- Cross-format migration and power-loss recovery remain unproven; no 99% first-boot AI success claim.
- Telegram input can be dropped after an offset failure; output has no durable retry queue.
- iOS background hotword listening is unsupported.
