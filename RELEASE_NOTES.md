# Agent J 0.17.2a1 release notes

Host 0.17.2a1 / install 0.21.3; phone-web scope.
Phone parity must pass --strict. Full Android/Telegram parity is incomplete.
Full Android/Telegram parity is incomplete.
No APK is included in this release. Android source is for review, not a released app.

Publication status: local preparation only. Live site verification is DEFERRED until
the public commit and tag are pushed, the site is deployed, and cold installation passes.

On publication failure, restore v0.17.1a1 host/site/phone artifacts; reuse published Dashboard C. No new D1 migration or relay change.
## Changes

- Native bots resolve the selected Claude/Codex/Gemini/OpenCode executable before environment scrub; explicit paths outside service PATH remain authoritative.
- Trusted pre-spawn failure settles that model reservation to zero. Started calls with unknown usage remain reserved; historical unknown reservations are not manually changed.
- Owner bot settings distinguish missing, non-executable, unresolved selection and spawn failure without exposing argv, stderr or credentials.
- Preserve OpenCode --pure and tool/MCP/plugin/workspace isolation; stdin prompts and native authentication. Package/site A then phone B; reuse Dashboard C. COREv8 unchanged.

- Real local native bot replies with selected OpenCode and no opencode in PATH; genuine QA installed-package, Noise/card/main-Agent reply and finally cleanup are recorded separately.
- P101 production bot/Jev conversations, daily limits and full embed refresh chain remain operator acceptance. Standalone QA SSH auth environment is not proven equivalent to the service.
- P102 unread pager/corner navigation and P105 setup-agents are integrated and serially requalified in P106. Installer reuses genuinely callable Claude/Codex/OpenCode login; Gemini main-agent adaptation is deferred backlog.
- Physical phone/Android/macOS remain pending; cloud installation-code redemption is a fixture, separately disclosed from real setup/installer/Noise/model acceptance.

## Material acceptance limits

- Android arbitrary-name wake recognition, false-accept/false-reject rates, background operation,
  battery behavior and speech-model licensing are not cleared for a released app.
- Paid-provider sound and cost are unverified; no complete voice catalogue or hardware benchmarks.
- Cross-format migration and power-loss recovery remain unproven; no 99% first-boot AI success claim.
- Telegram input can be dropped after an offset failure; output has no durable retry queue.
- iOS background hotword listening is unsupported.
