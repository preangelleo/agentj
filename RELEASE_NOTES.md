# Agent J 0.15.8a1 release notes

Host 0.15.8a1 / install 0.19.8; phone-web scope.
Phone parity must pass --strict. Full Android/Telegram parity is incomplete.
Full Android/Telegram parity is incomplete.
No APK is included in this release. Android source is for review, not a released app.

Publication status: local preparation only. Live site verification is DEFERRED until
the public commit and tag are pushed, the site is deployed, and cold installation passes.

On publication failure, restore v0.15.7a1 and its published main, including the site.
## Changes

- Sparse JSON5 configuration with transactional application, configuration history and migrations.
- Optional configuration skill for locally installed agent harnesses; owner permission required.
- Opt-in own-key cloud speech and local phone read-aloud.
- Optional owner-private Telegram text input and final replies.

- First-use onboarding: after activation the installing agent is guided to the seat, then this computer's browser,
  then the owner's main phone (`agentj onboarding`, doctor `onboard` line).
- The first approved remote gets one welcome written by the main agent (a fixed host text when no agent runs),
  then a short step-by-step tour the owner can skip; later remotes get one line. Upgraded hosts are never welcomed.
- Host, install guide and site only: no relay, phone web, Dashboard, D1 or Stripe change.
- Real-device phone acceptance remains pending; the browser-side evidence is local Chromium.

## Material acceptance limits

- Android arbitrary-name wake recognition, false-accept/false-reject rates, background operation,
  battery behavior and speech-model licensing are not cleared for a released app.
- Paid-provider sound and cost are unverified; no complete voice catalogue or hardware benchmarks.
- Cross-format migration and power-loss recovery remain unproven; no 99% first-boot AI success claim.
- Telegram input can be dropped after an offset failure; output has no durable retry queue.
- iOS background hotword listening is unsupported.
