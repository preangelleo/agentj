## Changes

- The remote count on the chat screen's gear is back on its original light circle; the number now takes the current status colour.
- Devices signed in to the same iCloud or Google account no longer replace each other's Touch ID; if one says it can't find it, set it up once more.
- 聊天界面右上角齿轮上的遥控器数量，圆底恢复原来的白色，数字颜色跟随当前背景状态色。
- 之前在同一 iCloud / Google 账号下的几台设备会互相顶掉 Touch ID，现已修好；如果某台提示找不到，重新设置一次即可。

## Material acceptance limits

- Android arbitrary-name wake recognition, false-accept/false-reject rates, background operation,
  battery behavior and speech-model licensing are not cleared for a released app.
- Paid-provider sound and cost are unverified; no complete voice catalogue or hardware benchmarks.
- Cross-format migration and power-loss recovery remain unproven; no 99% first-boot AI success claim.
- Telegram input can be dropped after an offset failure; output has no durable retry queue.
- iOS background hotword listening is unsupported.
