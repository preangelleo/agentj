# Agent J 0.15.4a1 release notes

Host 0.15.4a1 / install 0.19.4; phone-web scope.
Phone parity must pass --strict. Full Android/Telegram parity is incomplete.
Full Android/Telegram parity is incomplete.
No APK is included in this release. Android source is for review, not a released app.

Publication status: local preparation only. Live site verification is DEFERRED until
the public commit and tag are pushed, the site is deployed, and cold installation passes.

On publication failure, restore v0.15.3a1 / public 6dc4b79, including the site.
## Changes

- Sparse JSON5 configuration with transactional application, configuration history and migrations.
- Optional configuration skill for locally installed agent harnesses; owner permission required.
- Opt-in own-key cloud speech and local phone read-aloud.
- Optional owner-private Telegram text input and final replies.

- Fix: the default settings (shared session) now start OpenCode 2.x too (0.15.3a1 refused it there); Agent J's
  own OpenCode follows the installed version, OpenCode's own permission rules apply. An OpenCode 2.x server
  the owner started (agent.shared_opencode_port) is not attached: the phone says so and what to change.
- Fix: `agentj update apply` prints its UPGRADE_RESULT when the service re-install fails (was a traceback);
  macOS service install / restart waits for launchd to unload the old label before bootstrapping it again.
- Evidence: fake servers in CI and a local real-model run on OpenCode 1.18.32 and 2.0.23 in both modes;
  real macOS / a friend's computer acceptance is pending.

## Material acceptance limits

- Android arbitrary-name wake recognition, false-accept/false-reject rates, background operation,
  battery behavior and speech-model licensing are not cleared for a released app.
- Paid-provider sound and cost are unverified; no complete voice catalogue or hardware benchmarks.
- Cross-format migration and power-loss recovery remain unproven; no 99% first-boot AI success claim.
- Telegram input can be dropped after an offset failure; output has no durable retry queue.
- iOS background hotword listening is unsupported.
